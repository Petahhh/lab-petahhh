# Dashboard goodies

Workshops can embed fun features for the dashboard.

Take a journey down memory lane:

```dashboard:open-url
url: https://neopets.com
```

Did you know this thing had an in browser code editor?

```dashboard:open-dashboard
name: Editor
```

Sometimes you just need more terminal windows

```dashboard:create-dashboard
name: ExtraTerminalForYa
url: terminal:extra-term-for-ya
```
