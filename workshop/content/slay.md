# Heyyyyy

Welcome to the party!

```execute
echo "haaaaahhhh"
```

```execute-1
echo "we on top"
```

```execute-2
echo "hello from down under"
```

```execute-all
echo "hello everywhere"
```

```copy
echo "Copy Pasta... hmmm carbs"
```

```terminal:execute
command: echo "Ten second tidy!"
clear: true
```

```copy-and-edit
echo "Copy Pasta remix"
```

```terminal:execute
command: echo "This is a block of YAML and the preferred way to quickly let workshopers quickly execute code"
session: 2
```

```terminal:execute
command: echo "let's take a nap" && sleep 1000
session: 1
```

```terminal:execute
command: echo "let's take a nap" && sleep 1000
session: 2
```

```terminal:interrupt
session: 1
```

Let's have a heart to heart:

```terminal:execute
command: while read line; do echo "$line"; done < "/dev/stdin"
```

Let me reflect that back to you:

```terminal:input
text: this pandemic has been hard
```

Tell me more, but can you expand on that?

```terminal:input
text: the hardest part has been ...
endl: false
```

Okay free therapy is over:

```terminal:interrupt-all
```
